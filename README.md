### ğŸ”¹ **Project Introduction â€“ HelloBuddy: Real-Time Chat Web Application**

**HelloBuddy** is a full-stack real-time chat application designed to provide users with a smooth, secure, and interactive messaging experience. Developed as part of the B.Tech AI course at **SRM Universityâ€“AP**, the project demonstrates the integration of multiple modern web technologies to build a production-ready communication platform.

The core purpose of HelloBuddy is to enable users to connect, chat, and stay updated with their buddies in real time. The application allows users to **register or log in securely using email credentials**, update their **profile picture and display name**, and engage in **live conversations with online/offline indicators**, all supported by **Socket.IO** for real-time communication. Additionally, HelloBuddy supports **theme customization**, allowing users to personalize their interface for a more engaging experience.

The **frontend** is built using **React.js with Next.js** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, adopting a modular and component-based architecture. Key pages include Home, Chat, Login/Register, Profile, and Settings, with clear navigation and responsive design principles. The **backend** leverages **Node.js and Express.js**, incorporating **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user authentication, and **MongoDB** for storing user data, chat history, and preferences. Robust error handling and validation mechanisms ensure smooth and safe operation across the system.

Data storage is managed using MongoDB collections for Users, Messages, and Theme Preferences. Real-time updates, user authentication, and secure API routes are implemented following RESTful principles. Testing was conducted using **Postman** for API verification and **MongoDB Compass** to inspect database entries.

The HelloBuddy team emphasized code maintainability, responsiveness, and scalability throughout development. While the current version focuses on essential chat features, several future enhancements are proposed, including **email verification, AI-based chat suggestions, advanced friend recommendations, voice/video calling**, and **mobile app integration**.

Overall, HelloBuddy serves as a solid demonstration of collaborative development, modern full-stack engineering, and real-time application design in alignment with industry practices.
