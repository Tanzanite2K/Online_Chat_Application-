# Online_Chat_Application
HelloBuddy is a real-time messaging web application built to provide a seamless and interactive communication platform for users. Designed with a strong focus on user experience, performance, and modern design principles, HelloBuddy enables users to register, log in securely, and chat dynamically with friends. It supports real-time features like online status indicators using Socket.IO, customizable themes, and live profile management including display pictures, active status, and user preferences.

The project leverages a full-stack JavaScript architecture with React.js and Tailwind CSS on the frontend, and Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB on the backend. Authentication is securely handled using JWT tokens, and APIs are tested using Postman. The entire system is designed to be modular, scalable, and visually intuitive â€” aligning well with real-world messaging application standards.
