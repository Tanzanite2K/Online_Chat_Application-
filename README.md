# Online_Chat_Application

**HelloBuddy** is a real-time messaging web application developed as part of the **MERN Stack Development course**. It showcases a fully functional and interactive chat platform built using modern web technologies, with an emphasis on real-time communication, responsive design, and secure user management.

The application allows users to **sign up, log in securely**, and **chat live** with friends while viewing their **online status** in real-time using **Socket.IO**. It also offers features like **profile customization** (display picture, active status, and email updates) and **theme personalization** to enhance user experience.

The project follows a complete **MERN stack architecture**:

* **Frontend:** Built with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed using reusable components and responsive layouts. Key pages include Home, Chat, Profile, Login/Register, and Settings.
* **Backend:** Developed using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, implementing **JWT-based authentication** for secure login and session management.
* **Database:** **MongoDB** stores user credentials, profile data, chat history, and optional theme preferences.

Real-time functionality is achieved using **Socket.IO**, which powers live messaging and online indicators. **Postman** and **MongoDB Compass** were used for API and database testing during development.

HelloBuddy highlights collaborative teamwork, scalable architecture, and practical application of MERN technologies. Future enhancements include **email verification**, **voice/video chat**, **AI-powered chat suggestions**, and **mobile app support** using React Native.

This project demonstrates not only technical proficiency with the MERN stack but also a clear understanding of real-world app design, user experience, and secure data handling.
